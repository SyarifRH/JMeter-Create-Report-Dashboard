# JMeter-Create-Report-Dashboard

> To better highlight and separate certain information from the rest in your documentation on GitHub, we now render a special and accessible **note** or **warning** blockquote in Markdown documents. We are using the existing syntax for blockquote and bold text.
> 
> > Note
> > The first line must be exactly as shown below. The first letter is case sensitive. The second line can contain your content.
> 
> **This input:**
> 
> ```
> > **Note**
> > This is a note
> 
> > **Warning**
> > This is a warning
> ```
> 
> **Becomes:**
> 
> > Note
> > This is a note
> 
> > Warning
> > This is a warning
> 
> Let us know what you think and how this helps you provide better documentation. Please note that this is a beta feature that might be subject to change.
